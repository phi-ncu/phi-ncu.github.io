### Bio
I'm a Master graduate in Physics of Complex Systems with a strong interest in the topics of Machine Learning and Deep learning as well as Network Neuroscience. I just started my Ph.D. in which I will study the mechanisms that allow brain to form graph representations of complex networks from the external world. In my free time I enjoy outdoor sports, especially trekking and climbing, listening to electronic music, going to cinema and theater.
