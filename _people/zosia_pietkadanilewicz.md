### Bio

I'm a Cognitive Science student at Nicolaus Copernicus Univeristy in Toruń, Poland. My main area of interest is focused on decision-making processes according to emotional and motivational state, causality in neural networks and visual aesthetic experience. Currently I conduct research connected with encoding BIS/BAS motivation from neurophysiological brain activity and another one focused on Generative BCI paradigm that merges together Generative Adversarial Networks and Brain-Computer Interface to create personalized and visually attractive images according to brain activity.
