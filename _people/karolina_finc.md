### Bio

I’m a cognitive scientist working as assistant professor at the Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies 
at Nicolaus Copernicus University. In 2019, I defended my PhD at the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Informatics 
at the Nicolaus Copernicus University. In my research I want to understand how the network organization and dynamics 
shape our experience. I'm also passionate about human creativity, music, 
philosophy, nature, photography, dance, singing, and mathematics. 
I love to improvise in every domain of my life - from playing around with various musical instruments to combining 
seemingly distant concepts in science.
