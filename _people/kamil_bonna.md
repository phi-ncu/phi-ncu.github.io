### Bio

I'm a physicist, currently finishing my Ph.D. and working as a research assistant at the Department of Cognitive Science at Nicolaus Copernicus University. 
My research focuses on the brain mechanisms underlying human decision-making. 
Specifically, I'm interested in linking prediction error coding with brain connectivity. 
Privately, I dance popping, I'm interested in hip-hop culture and cinematography. 
I love cooking and always try to promote a healthy lifestyle.
