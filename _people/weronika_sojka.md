### Bio

I am a Cognitive Science's student at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland. I am interested in neuroplasticity, learning and memory processes. I am training myself in neuroimaging data analysis (mostly EEG and fMRI data). Currently, I am working on research projects around topics such as reproducibility, cognitive maps and graphs, and brain-computer interfaces applications. In my free time, I love to visit new places, spend hours walking or riding a bike, but as soon as I get home, I'm taking care of my two cats.
